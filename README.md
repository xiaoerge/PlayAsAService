# Play as a Service (PaaS)

## Play random games like `Dice`, `Rock Paper Scissors` on social media sites.

## The idea is to be able to paste a PaaS url into websites like Slack, Facebook or Twitter and generate random beautiful results each time.

### Known issues
- Formatting of PaaS on social media websites.
- Caching by social media.
